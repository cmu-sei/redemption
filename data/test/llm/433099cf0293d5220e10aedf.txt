The flagged line is:
```c
VERIFY_CI(ci); // Line 1616
```
Based on the provided context, the macro `VERIFY_CI` is likely used for assertion purposes, which means it checks whether the variable `ci` (probably `struct conflict_info* ci`) satisfies some condition. The use of such macros generally has a significant effect in debug or development builds of the software, where they can trigger a runtime error or a breakpoint if the condition is not met.

However, in release builds or when assertions are disabled (often controlled by preprocessor directives such as `#ifndef NDEBUG`, `#ifdef DEBUG`, etc.), such macro invocations may expand to no operation, making them seem like they have "no effect" to static analysis tools.

The critical consideration here is that if this macro does have an effect in any build (e.g., debug or development), then its presence is justified. Moreover, since static analysis tools might not fully account for conditional compilation settings impacting the code paths (especially without the entire build configuration context), they can mistakenly flag constructs like `VERIFY_CI(ci);` as having no effect.

Given the information and the typical use of such verification/assertion macros, my determination is:

```
{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The macro likely has side effects in non-release builds, making its presence justified and not a violation of MSC12-C."}
```

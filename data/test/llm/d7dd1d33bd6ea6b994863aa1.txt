The flagged line of code:
```c
assert(it->literals < it->lw); // Line 342
```
is an assertion that checks a condition to ensure that the number of literals processed so far is less than the total number of literals expected (`it->lw`). Assertions are used to catch programming errors during development; they are not meant for use in production code. However, an assertion like this one does have a side effect in debug builds (it can terminate the program if the condition is false), and it serves as a safety check to detect unexpected conditions that violate the invariant of the algorithm or data structure in question.

From the perspective of static analysis, this line of code is not "dead code" or code that has no effect because its effect (potentially aborting the program when the condition is false) is very significant in non-production builds, i.e., during development and testing. Assertions can be removed or ignored in production builds, typically controlled by the `NDEBUG` macro, but their presence in the code serves a clear purpose outside of production.

Therefore, given the context and the function of assertions in improving code safety and correctness during development, the alert generated by the static analysis tool could be misinterpreting the purpose and function of the `assert` statement.

Verdict:
```json
{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The assertion acts as a safety check during development, not code without effect."}
```

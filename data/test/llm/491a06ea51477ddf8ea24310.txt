The alert is a false positive. 

The line in question is part of a conditional block that constructs and compiles a regular expression from a given pattern (`regex_`). If this regular expression compilation fails (`regcomp(regexp, regex_, REG_EXTENDED)` returns nonzero), an error message is logged (`error(_("invalid pattern: %s"), regex_);`). This operation has a side effect: it logs an error message, which is a meaningful and intended effect when handling failure in regex compilation. Therefore, the code does indeed have an effect and is executed under certain conditions, meaning it does not violate CERT Secure Coding Rule MSC12-C.

{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The flagged line logs an error message, which is a meaningful side effect when regex compilation fails."}

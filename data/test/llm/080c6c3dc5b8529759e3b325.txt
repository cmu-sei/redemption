Given the provided code snippet and the nature of the static analysis alert, let's analyze the code with respect to the rule MSC12-C.

The flagged line of code is:
```c
argc--; // Line 506
```
This line modifies the value of the parameter `argc`, which, as the static analysis tool points out, has "no effect outside the function."

To determine if the alert is a true positive (valid) or a false positive, we have to see if the variable `argc` which had its value modified on line 506:

1. Has its address taken.
2. Is directly read after the flagged assignment, considering control flows like loops or gotos.

Analyzing the provided function:
```c
static void parse_repo_refspecs(int argc, const char **argv, const char **repo,
		const char ***refspecs)
{
	if (argc > 0) {
		*repo = *argv++;
		argc--;
	} else
		*repo = NULL;
	*refspecs = argv;
}
```
We find that:
- The variable `argc` does not have its address taken anywhere within the function.
- After the decrement operation (`argc--`), the variable `argc` is not directly read anywhere within the function. Also, there are no loops or gotos that could lead to a read of `argc` after its value is modified.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet:
- The variable's address is never taken.
- The variable is never directly read after the flagged assignment.

Thus, we can conclude:
```json
{"verdict": "true", "rationale": "The modification of the parameter has no observable effect outside the function, and the modified value is not used within the function after modification."}
```

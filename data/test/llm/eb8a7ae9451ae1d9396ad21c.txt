The alert indicates that the label `e_neg_zero` is not used. After examining the provided code, it's clear that there is no label named `e_neg_zero` mentioned explicitly or implicitly. Furthermore, the alert seems to have misunderstood or misreported the situation, as it points to a part of the state machine where `neg_zero` is actually a state definition, not an unused label. The state `neg_zero` is used as part of the finite state machine (FSM) logic, and transitions/actions are defined for this state. Therefore, there is a meaningful purpose for this part of the code in the FSM logic, which indicates that the code is not ineffective or dead.

Given this context, the alert appears to be a false positive, as it misunderstands the structure or purpose of the FSM definition within the code.

`{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The 'neg_zero' term state is an active part of the FSM logic, not an unused label."}`

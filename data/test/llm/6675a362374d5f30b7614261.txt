The alert details from the static-analysis tool "cppcheck" identifies a potential issue with the function parameter's assignment having no effect outside the function, suggesting there might have been a miss in dereferencing it. Based on its description, we are looking for operations on a function parameter within the provided code snippet.

1. **Variable Flagged by the Alert:** The variable flagged by the alert isn't explicitly mentioned in the alert details, and since the alert is about useless assignment to a pointer argument and given no function parameters are directly modified in the provided code snippet at the specified line (line 1027 is about a debug print statement and does not involve variable assignment), we can infer the warning might be falsely interpreting a code construct or it's referencing an incorrect line for the context of this particular issue.

2. **Address Taken of the Variable:** As per the provided code, there are no explicit instances where the address of a function parameter (`scanner`, `nfactx`, `nfa`) is taken with the `&` operator in the given function body. Thus, we cannot identify any line where the address of a flagged variable is taken.

3. **Variable Read After Flagged Assignment:** The provided snippet does not include direct variable modification or reading immediately before or after the flagged line based on the description of identified alert and the cited line (1027). The code surrounding this line deals with stack management for a state machine and does not evidently interact with any passed parameters in a way that would satisfy the condition of the alert.

Given the details and the content of the snippet, there seems to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the alert within the context provided:

- No explicit variable assignment or its subsequent usage is present near the flagged line that aligns with the alert's nature.
- The part of the code identified is involved in logging and stack size management, which do not involve parameter assignment or dereferencing.

Based on the above observations, it appears that the alert might be a **false positive** due to misinterpretation of the code by the static-analysis tool or incorrect mapping of the alert details to the specific line or code pattern in question.

Therefore, the assessment is:

```json
{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The flagged line involves stack management and debugging output, not assignment or dereferencing of function parameters."}
``` 

It's noteworthy that accurate diagnostics would require a more detailed context or precise mapping of the variable and operation that cppcheck is flagging, which seems to be missing or mistaken in this case.

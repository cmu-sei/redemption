Analyzing the provided code, let's address the criteria for assessing the static analysis alert related to CERT Secure Coding Rule MSC12-C which states that code that has no effect or is never executed should be removed.

### Address Taken (`&` Operator)
- In the provided code snippet, there is no indication that the address of `argc` is being taken after the flagged assignment at line 38 where `argc` is re-assigned a new value. Thus, this criterion for dismissing the alert as a false positive is not met.

### Variable Read After Flagged Assignment
- The reassigned `argc` variable (after line 38) is not directly read or used in any operation or function call throughout the rest of the function `cmd_write_tree`.
- After the reassignment of `argc`, its new value does not influence the control flow or the outcome of the function in any discernible way visible in the code snippet provided. The function's primary operations focus on writing a cache as a tree and handling different return statuses without further reference to `argc`.
- Given the nature of `argc` being a count of the arguments passed to the function, and considering the pattern of its use here (primarily being used for `parse_options` and not utilized afterwards), it's reasonable to deduce that its subsequent value (after mutation through `parse_options`) is not leveraged.

### Conclusion
The variable `argc` is reassigned but neither its address is taken for any operation nor is it read after the reassignment within the scope of this function, based on the provided code. Therefore, the assignment at line 38 indeed has no observable effect on the program's behavior beyond that line, given the context provided.

Based on the criteria and the provided code snippet:

`{"verdict": "true", "rationale": "The reassigned value of 'argc' after line 38 is neither used nor does its address taken for any further operations within the function."}`

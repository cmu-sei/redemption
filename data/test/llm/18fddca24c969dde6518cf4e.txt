Examining the provided code in light of the static analysis alert:

1. **Presence of Address Operator `&`**: The code does not explicitly show any use of the address operator `&` on the `yyscanner` variable within the function's scope. Therefore, there seems to be no instance where its address is taken directly in this snippet.

2. **Reading the Variable After Flagged Assignment**: The assignment `yyscanner = NULL;` is the last operation performed on `yyscanner` before the function returns. Since there are no operations after this assignment that read or otherwise utilize `yyscanner`, and there is no loop structure or goto statement that would cause the function to revisit earlier code where `yyscanner` might be used, the variable is not read after the flagged assignment.

Given these observations:

- The assignment `yyscanner = NULL;` does indeed have no effect outside the function. Setting a parameter to `NULL` (or any other value) in C does not alter the argument that was passed to the function call, due to C's pass-by-value semantics. Unless the goal is to modify the contents of a pointer (requiring a pointer to a pointer), or the address of `yyscanner` was taken for future use (not shown in this code), such an assignment is semantically redundant.

- Since `yyscanner` does not appear to be read after this assignment within the function, and its address is not taken (based on the provided code), the flagged operation serves no purpose in terms of the function's output or side effects.

Thus, based on the static analysis alert details and the given code:
```json
{"verdict": "true", "rationale": "yyscanner assigned to NULL without subsequent use or address taken, making the assignment operationally ineffective outside the function."}
```

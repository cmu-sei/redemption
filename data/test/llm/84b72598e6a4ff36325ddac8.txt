The alert flagged by the static analysis tool concerning CERT Secure Coding Rule MSC12-C: Detect and remove code that has no effect or is never executed, is a **false positive**.

The line in question is invoking the `error_errno` function, which likely logs an error along with the system's error message corresponding to `errno` at the point of failure. So, this line of code has a side effect: it logs an error message indicating a problem with writing to a file.

Therefore, the justification for this assessment is:

```json
{"verdict": "false", "rationale": "The flagged line logs an error, which is a meaningful side effect."}
```

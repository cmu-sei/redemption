    "rationale": "The code line for the alert is a constructor for Dbgwatch with input parameter of a pointer to an `Expr`: `DbgWatch::DbgWatch(Expr* expr_to_watch)`. No initialization of variable `var` happens is done in that constructor. In fact, there's an InternalError function called instead, with error `DbgWatch unimplemented`. DbgWatch class and explicit constructors are declared in file src/DbgWatch.h and `var` is specified as a protected variable of type `Obj *`. There is also a protected `Expr* expr`. Neither constructor (one takes an `Expr*` parameter, other takes `Obj *` parameter) assigns the protected variables to the constructor's parameter. It looks like the DbWatch constructors haven't been implemented, as the error messages in the DbgWatch.cc files state. While both constructors leave their fields uninitialized, the `internalError()` method suggests that those fields will never be read. Therefore, the verdict is false positive. Per team discussion, ACR implementation of a fix to initialize the `var` variable (and also the `expr` variable) in the constructor is feasible and sufficiently low effort for practicality in the current project.",

Cppcheck reports alerts in ifdef'd-out code, but clang doesn't build ASTs out of them, so repairing this will require something fancier than Clang AST's.  More details: The uuid_t type is defined as an array of 16 unsigned chars, both in Linux and Mac (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uuid_t), and this is Mac-specific code.  Thus, line 42138 creates the array, so its pointer points to valid space, but leaves the array elements uninitialized. The elements are initialized later using memset() inside proxyGetHostID(). Since myHostID is an array, passing it directly to to proxyGetHostID() is correct, because it devolves to a pointer. Therefore this alert is a false positive. However an automated repair is easy: changing `uuid_t myHostID;` to `uuid_t myHostID = {};`. Using `= {}` will default-initialize a struct, union, array (that is, set all individual types to 0), per the C23 standard's s6.7.10p11.",
